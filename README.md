Target user profile:

The objective of the resume, apart from being a task that must be submitted, has an informative use for anyone who wants to be interested in me and my qualities. Here you can find my academic data, personal data, knowledge of applications and programming codes, languages, personal summary, various information... All on a simple but pleasant page with beautiful aesthetics.

Information architecture:


I decided to divide the resume into sections. A “navigation” section for basic information, an “article” section for the main content of the resume, an “aside” section for the menu on the right, and a “footer” for information below the page. Furthermore, in the Knowledge section, it has been divided into two so that there was a distinction between codes and general applications. It has been longer than one page to be able to enter all the relevant information. 

Visual Design:

For the resume I opted for something simple but attractive to the eye. As in my paper and static resume, I wanted to decorate it with a gradient to the left and right to give more detail to the center and give more emphasis to what is important. I decided to put my photo at the top left next to the name. Then, below the photo, the date of birth and contact information: telephone, email and usual address. Then the skills, languages and extra information. Then, in the central part are my studies, certifications, knowledge in different areas and a brief personal summary with links to different projects. Furthermore, distributed throughout the document, every text that refers to an entity, project or certificate, has an access link for its veracity and more information with the institution. Finally, the right side has a language selector: Catalan, Spanish and English. Then followed by a slight menu with each of the sections for quick access. At the bottom, a short text with the copyright and my student code from the University of Girona, so that the professor can correct me faster.

The colors chosen are green (something nice for the eyes) with a slight gradient to make it more attractive, so that it is not a simple color, and then blue and purple to contrast with the white of the central background. In addition, the typography is different and somewhat calm, more rounded and pleasing to the eye but still formal. Also, the knowledge section was found on a web page as an idea and I wanted to reproduce it in the document (without copying code, just inspiration). The other elements are completely mine and from the curriculum that I had already made before the project
